# Drowsiness-Detection-and-Alert-System
The proposed project aims to detect signs of drowsiness in students studying for exams and drivers behind the wheel. 
The core idea is to employ real-time facial analysis through a webcam to monitor individuals' levels of wakefulness and activate an alarm when drowsiness is detected, thereby mitigating the risk of catastrophic accidents. The system capitalizes on cutting-edge computer vision and facial recognition technologies. By utilizing a webcam, the system continuously captures a video stream of the individual in focus, whether a student engrossed in studying or a driver on the road. Facial landmarks, especially the coordinates of the eyes, are extracted and analyzed in real-time. These landmarks play a pivotal role in determining whether the individual is exhibiting signs of drowsiness, as drooping eyelids and extended blink patterns are indicative of reduced wakefulness. This project stands at the intersection of technology and safety. The successful implementation of this project has the potential to significantly reduce the occurrence of accidents caused by drowsiness, both in educational and transportation contexts, thus enhancing overall safety and well-being.
